# ConfigServer Firewall Shutdown: Community Responses and Alternatives

ConfigServer Security & Firewall (CSF) officially shut down on August 31, 2025, ending updates and downloads for this widely used Linux firewall suite[\[1\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=,cmm)[\[2\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Will%20your%20free%20scripts%20continue,after%20the%2031st%20of%20August%3F%E2%80%8B). Despite the shutdown, existing CSF installations continue to work (there is no “kill switch” for the free CSF)[\[3\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20ConfigServer%20Mail%20Manage%20,available%20for%20download%20or%20install). However, new installations can no longer fetch CSF from the vendor site, and the software is not being developed for newer technologies like *nftables* (required by upcoming RHEL/AlmaLinux 10\)[\[4\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20like%20%40zEitEr%20and%20I,it%20can%27t%20be%20installed%20anyway)[\[5\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Probably%20that%20is%20the%20reason,it%20still%20works%20very%20good). This has prompted extensive discussions in the hosting community about how to proceed. Below we summarize recent community responses (from late July 2025 onward) – including actions by control panel vendors and users – and evaluate free alternatives such as using **firewalld** (nftables) with fail2ban or even a *“csf wrapper”* approach for the future.

## Reactions from Control Panel Communities

**DirectAdmin:** DirectAdmin has traditionally integrated CSF/LFD (Login Failure Daemon) as a one-click install via its CustomBuild system. With the CSF developers ceasing distribution, DirectAdmin users anticipate that official support will be removed in future updates[\[6\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=). In fact, DirectAdmin staff and community moderators have advised that new installations will require obtaining the CSF package from an alternate source (for example, a saved copy or mirror) if one wishes to continue using it[\[7\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20we%20can%20still%20use,tgz%20in%20your%20own%20repository)[\[8\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=them%20after%208%2F31,be%20able%20to%20install%20it). Users note that as long as you have the csf.tgz archive saved, you **can** still install and run CSF on supported OS versions (RHEL 7/8/9, AlmaLinux 8/9, etc.), but **not** on AlmaLinux/RHEL 10 which use nftables only[\[7\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20we%20can%20still%20use,tgz%20in%20your%20own%20repository)[\[4\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20like%20%40zEitEr%20and%20I,it%20can%27t%20be%20installed%20anyway). DirectAdmin’s own Brute Force Monitor can handle some tasks (login/SSH brute-force detection), but it doesn’t fully replace CSF’s LFD functionality[\[9\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=). Community members have suggested combining **Fail2Ban** with the panel as an alternative, although that would require integration effort or a custom DirectAdmin plugin for a web UI[\[10\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=For%20the%20more%20technical%20among,a%20WebUI%20integrated%20into%20DA). At this time, DirectAdmin’s likely short-term approach is to stop offering CSF in CustomBuild by default (unless the now-open-sourced CSF can be redistributed) and encourage admins to manage firewalls manually or via other tools[\[6\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=)[\[11\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=,Click%20to%20expand). Indeed, one DA admin noted it’s “stinky for new users” who won’t know what they’re missing once CSF is removed[\[12\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=,Click%20to%20expand), underscoring how entrenched CSF was in that ecosystem.

**cPanel/WHM:** cPanel never bundled CSF officially, but many cPanel server admins installed CSF for its deep integration with WHM. The shutdown triggered discussions on cPanel forums and Reddit about alternatives. Some users lament that cPanel never acquired or integrated CSF into WHM core[\[13\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpanel/comments/1mdmyc8/way_to_the_web_csf_are_going_to_cease_to_exist/#:~:text=%E2%80%A2%20%2028d%20ago), as that would have preserved it. In cPanel’s support forums, users have been asking for replacement recommendations. Common *commercial* suggestions include CloudLinux’s **Imunify360** (a comprehensive security suite) and OpsShield **cPGuard**, or services like BitNinja[\[14\]](https://support.cpanel.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/33871947312407-CSF-Closing-Down-Permanently-Any-alternatives#:~:text=Imunify360%20seems%20to%20be%20well,far%20the%20most%20expensive%20alternate). These offer GUI integration with cPanel and similar features to CSF+LFD, but they are paid solutions. For those seeking free alternatives, the focus is on using cPanel’s built-in **cPHulk** (which protects against brute force logins) combined with a system firewall like firewalld/iptables or Fail2Ban. cPHulk alone is not a full firewall; it handles login/IP bans for services like SSH/FTP/WHM. Therefore, many cPanel sysadmins are now looking at using **Fail2Ban plus the OS firewall** to cover what LFD did, and using firewalld/iptables to manage ports. On Reddit, one cPanel user noted, *“I guess I’ll translate everything to firewalld and go from there”*, expressing resignation that they must manually replicate CSF’s rules using firewalld[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpanel/comments/1mdmyc8/way_to_the_web_csf_are_going_to_cease_to_exist/#:~:text=heavinglory). The sentiment in /r/cpanel and /r/sysadmin is that while nothing matches CSF’s all-in-one convenience (especially its WHM UI), the path forward may be a combination of native tools (firewalld or UFW and Fail2Ban) unless a community fork of CSF steps in.

**Centmin Mod:** The Centmin Mod LEMP stack, a popular automation script for Nginx/PHP on CentOS/AlmaLinux, has long included CSF by default. Centmin Mod’s developer reacted swiftly to the CSF news. By late August, they set up a **self-hosted mirror** for CSF and modified the installer to fetch from that mirror[\[16\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=on%20Centmin%20Mod%20users,For%20Existing%20Centmin%20Mod%20Users). Importantly, they **patched the CSF code** (version 14.24) to remove its hardcoded calls home to download.configserver.com and instead point to the CentminMod domain[\[17\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=Function%20wise%20as%20CSF%20Firewall%2C,CSF%20Firewall%20downloads%20to%20any). This means existing Centmin Mod users received an update switching their CSF installation to use Centmin Mod’s mirror for version checks and updates, thus insulating them from the official site shutdown[\[18\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,01). By August 29 (just before the closure), the Centmin Mod project had already updated their CSF package to **v15.01** – effectively incorporating ConfigServer’s final open-sourced release (v15.00) – but keeping Centmin’s update channel active[\[19\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,that%20update%20via%20CSF%20Firewall%27s)[\[20\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=version%20allows%20me%20to%20later,). In short, Centmin Mod is **continuing to bundle CSF**, now under the GPL license, and has ensured users can still use CSF’s auto-update (csf \-u) to get community updates from its mirror[\[17\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=Function%20wise%20as%20CSF%20Firewall%2C,CSF%20Firewall%20downloads%20to%20any). This proactive approach was possible because Centmin’s author prepared a custom edition as a stopgap even *before* the GPL release (acknowledging it was technically against CSF’s old license, but done as a contingency)[\[21\]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208109/configserver-csf-mail-scanner-exploit-scanner-etc-closing-down#:~:text=Cheers%20Mike,open%20source%20release%20goes)[\[22\]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208109/configserver-csf-mail-scanner-exploit-scanner-etc-closing-down#:~:text=They%20probably%20don%27t%20care%2C%20but,or%20reverse%20engineer%20the%20Product). Now that CSF is open source, Centmin Mod (and others) can legally maintain it. This example shows one path: **self-hosting the CSF code** and continuing to use it on current OS versions until a better solution or fork emerges.

**Other Panels (CWP, Hestia, etc.):** Many smaller control panels and hosting panels also relied on CSF. For instance, **Control Web Panel (CWP)** on CentOS streams has CSF integrated by default. CWP users on the forum noted that “every cPanel and CWP…use it” and that CSF’s disappearance “came out of nowhere”[\[23\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=It%20did%20come%20out%20of,nowhere). CWP discussions suggest the panel will likely switch to using **firewalld \+ Fail2Ban** with a GUI front-end as a replacement. One user wrote, “with our CWP, CSF is coming as default. So, it’s time to change it to FirewallD \+ Fail2Ban with a GUI”[\[24\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=but%20with%20our%20CWP%2C%20CSF,solution%20of%20it%20as%20well). This indicates CWP devs may pivot to leveraging firewalld (which is built into modern CentOS/AlmaLinux) and integrate Fail2Ban for intrusion detection. The idea of a custom GUI wrapping firewalld isn’t far-fetched, since firewalld can be controlled via commands or API and fail2ban can output status – the panel just needs to expose common actions (open/close ports, show banned IPs, etc.). Similarly, the **Hestia CP** team and users expressed concern since Hestia’s own firewall module (an iptables wrapper) is *“too basic for production use”* compared to CSF’s features[\[25\]](https://forum.hestiacp.com/t/sadly-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently-on-31-august-2025/19834#:~:text=While%20there%20is%20a%20basic,functionality%20the%20CSF%20firewall%20offers). A Hestia forum post urged users to grab the CSF tarball while available and voiced hope that CSF would be open-sourced so that Hestia could perhaps integrate it directly as a plugin or module[\[26\]](https://forum.hestiacp.com/t/sadly-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently-on-31-august-2025/19834#:~:text=I%20am%20pretty%20much%20sure,efficient%20on%20my%20multiple%20servers)[\[27\]](https://forum.hestiacp.com/t/sadly-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently-on-31-august-2025/19834#:~:text=Please%20read%20the%20change%20of,which%20is%20not%20yet%20finalized). Now that CSF is GPL, Hestia and others could indeed bundle it or a fork of it in the future. Other hosting panels like **Enhance** do not rely on CSF themselves, but some third-party security add-ons do – for example, OpsShield’s **cPGuard** (a malware/firewall suite) can use CSF if present. The cPGuard developers clarified that their product *does not require CSF* (it can manage its own iptables rules), and in light of CSF’s demise they announced an expanded internal firewall module *“to cover major functions in CSF”*, with a new version released by end of August[\[28\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=opsshield). This is essentially cPGuard adopting those features so users won’t miss CSF. Meanwhile, other security tools like **Imunify360** have their own firewalls and brute-force detection, so they are unaffected except that they might become more attractive as a one-stop solution (albeit a paid one) for hosts migrating away from CSF.

In summary, control panel vendors are taking **two main approaches**: (1) **Remove or phase out CSF support** (ensuring nothing breaks when CSF can’t be downloaded, and possibly providing basic alternatives like fail2ban or relying on OS firewalls), or (2) **Host their own copy/fork of CSF** to continue offering it, at least in the short term. DirectAdmin leans toward the former (with an expectation that new installations won’t include CSF unless the admin manually supplies it)[\[11\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=,Click%20to%20expand)[\[29\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Important%20notice,CSF%2FLFD%20in%20the%20nearest%20future), whereas Centmin Mod decisively chose the latter (maintaining CSF via their own mirror)[\[16\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=on%20Centmin%20Mod%20users,For%20Existing%20Centmin%20Mod%20Users)[\[19\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,that%20update%20via%20CSF%20Firewall%27s). Many users have downloaded the last CSF release to keep it in reserve, and some have preemptively configured their servers to **point to alternate update servers** so that CSF’s auto-update cron doesn’t try to contact the now-shutdown domain[\[30\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Registry%20Expiry%20Date%3A%202027)[\[31\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=which%20should%20be%20replaced%20by,com). (Notably, a DirectAdmin forum guide instructs changing /etc/csf/downloadservers from the default download.configserver.com to a trusted mirror domain to prevent any potential domain hijack or downtime issues[\[30\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Registry%20Expiry%20Date%3A%202027)[\[31\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=which%20should%20be%20replaced%20by,com).)

## Emergence of Community Forks and Mirrors

One silver lining is that the CSF developers hinted at – and eventually delivered – an open-source release. Initially, the ConfigServer team stated they were *“seriously considering releasing csf under the GPLv3 license”*[\[32\]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208109/configserver-csf-mail-scanner-exploit-scanner-etc-closing-down#:~:text=,available%20via%20our%20GitHub%20repository)[\[33\]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208109/configserver-csf-mail-scanner-exploit-scanner-etc-closing-down#:~:text=open,available%20via%20our%20GitHub%20repository). On July 31, 2025, they updated their blog to confirm *“we are working on releasing csf under the GPLv3 license… before we close for business”*[\[34\]](https://lowendtalk.com/discussion/208109/configserver-csf-mail-scanner-exploit-scanner-etc-closing-down#:~:text=Has%20now%20changed%20to%3A). This eased legal concerns and encouraged community members to plan forks. By August 29, just days before closure, **CSF v15.00** was published under GPLv3 on an official GitHub repository[\[35\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,csf.md). All of ConfigServer’s free scripts (including CSF, CXS, etc.) were made available at **github.com/waytotheweb/scripts** under GPLv3[\[35\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,csf.md). This means anyone can now fork and continue development of CSF legally.

Indeed, multiple community-driven initiatives sprung up: for example, a GitHub user had earlier created an *“OpenCSF”* project (Aetherinox’s repo) to extend CSF with new themes and features, though that was essentially a wrapper on top of the existing CSF and not an independent fork[\[36\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=new%20infrastructure%20for%20an%20open,version)[\[37\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=csf%20is%20NOT%20anti,virus%20like%20imunifyAV%2C%20etc). Another community member launched a site **ConfigServerFirewall.org** in an attempt to preserve documentation and rally developers, calling it “OpenCSF.” However, the person behind it (Eddie Cheng) paused the effort after speaking with the ConfigServer folks – they preferred not to have unofficial distributions until the official open-source release was out[\[38\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=eddiecheng). Once CSF was released under GNU GPL, he re-enabled the community site and shared the official GitHub link, expressing hope to *“find talented people to continue”* the project in that community[\[39\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub). We are already seeing forks on GitHub as enthusiasts prepare to improve CSF.

**Self-hosted mirrors** became a go-to solution in the interim. We discussed Centmin Mod’s mirror (which even preserves CSF’s auto-update functionality by hosting a version.txt and package file on a download.centminmod.com URL)[\[17\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=Function%20wise%20as%20CSF%20Firewall%2C,CSF%20Firewall%20downloads%20to%20any). Others have likely done similar for internal use. For example, web hosting companies that deploy CSF on customer servers have downloaded the installer tarball to their own servers so that their automation scripts can pull from there going forward. The DirectAdmin community explicitly recommended keeping a local copy of csf.tgz and even suggested that DirectAdmin, if allowed, could host CSF themselves to let CustomBuild install it post-closure[\[40\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=)[\[11\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=,Click%20to%20expand). However, until the GPL release, the CSF license technically forbade redistribution or modification[\[41\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Code%3A)[\[42\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=and%20if%20I%20get%20it,correct%20me%20if%20I%27m%20wrong), so official mirrors could not appear without permission. Now that it’s GPL, we may see more public mirrors or direct integration of the GitHub source.

One **important caution** raised in the community is the **security risk** of leaving servers configured to contact the defunct ConfigServer servers. Since the domain isn’t expiring immediately (ConfigServer’s domain is paid through Jan 2027\)[\[29\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Important%20notice,CSF%2FLFD%20in%20the%20nearest%20future), a malicious actor could potentially acquire the domain in the future and serve malicious content if any CSF installations still try to download updates from download.configserver.com. To mitigate this, admins are advised to edit the CSF configuration to point to a safe domain or simply disable auto-updates entirely[\[30\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Registry%20Expiry%20Date%3A%202027)[\[43\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=It%20should%20be%20fine%20if,etc%2Fcron.d%2Fcsf_update). In other words, if you continue running CSF, ensure it’s not phone-home updating from the old site. The community consensus is that **CSF (the software) can remain in use for now**, especially on existing servers, but it should be *“pinned”* to a safe source and monitored closely since no further official patches will come.

Going forward, an official or semi-official **community fork** of CSF may emerge (often dubbed “OpenCSF”). If that happens, many panel vendors and users would likely adopt it, as it could incorporate needed updates (for example, making it nftables-compatible for RHEL 10, fixing bugs, etc.). Until then, we’re in a transition period where CSF 14.x/15.0x continues to run on systems that have iptables, and everyone is exploring alternatives in parallel.

## Free Alternatives and Long-Term Solutions

For those seeking *free, non-paid* alternatives that cover the functionality of CSF and LFD, the common strategy is to combine the Linux distribution’s **native firewall** with an **intrusion detection/banning tool** like Fail2Ban:

* **Firewalld (nftables) or iptables**: All modern Linux distros include a built-in firewall system. RHEL-based systems use **firewalld** by default (which in RHEL8+ can manage both iptables and nftables backends; in RHEL 10 it will be nftables only[\[44\]](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/fibre-channel-networking/sannav/global-view-installation/2-4-0x/pre-install-checks-gv/Configuring-the-Firewalld-Backend.html#:~:text=Configuring%20the%20Firewalld%20Backend%20for,have%20native%20support%20for%20nftables)[\[45\]](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/552657/centos-8-firewalld-nftables-or-just-nftables#:~:text=CentOS%208%20firewalld%20%2B%20nftables,turning%20them%20into%20nftables%20rules)). Debian/Ubuntu systems often use **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)** as a front-end to iptables. These tools can replicate CSF’s *packet filtering* capabilities – i.e. port allow/deny, protocol restrictions, rate limiting, etc. Firewalld is dynamic and scriptable, with the concept of zones for different trust levels. UFW is a simpler interface for basic allow/deny rules. Both ultimately configure the kernel’s netfilter (iptables/nft) rules. In fact, **CSF itself was essentially a perl wrapper around iptables** plus a collection of scripts for log monitoring[\[46\]](https://www.hivelocity.net/kb/common-firewall-commands-iptables-csf-ufw-firewalld/#:~:text=Common%20Firewall%20Commands%3A%20Iptables%2C%20CSF%2C,that%20iptables%20does%20not%20offer). A DirectAdmin admin noted that *“firewalld and csf are both essentially wrappers that talk with underlying iptables”*[\[47\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/firewalld-or-iptables.58436/#:~:text=FirewallD%20or%20IPtables%3F%20,firewall%20and%20wrote%20a) – so using firewalld directly is a logical step if CSF is no longer available. Firewalld can do about “90% of what CSF does” according to one long-time Centmin user[\[48\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=,like%20login%20failure%20detection%2C%20I%27d), including features like connection tracking (stateful firewall) that CSF also leveraged. What firewalld (or raw iptables) lack is a built-in log scanning and automated banning component – that’s where LFD excelled.

* **Fail2Ban**: This open-source daemon monitors log files (SSH, web server, mail server logs, etc.) and creates temporary firewall bans for IPs that show malicious signs (failed logins, repeated 404 attacks, etc.). Fail2Ban can use iptables or firewalld as its action backend to insert ban rules. Many consider **Fail2Ban \+ firewalld** a viable replacement for CSF’s LFD portion[\[49\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=csf%20also%20hasn%27t%20been%20%27forked%27%2C,on%20to%20csf)[\[24\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=but%20with%20our%20CWP%2C%20CSF,solution%20of%20it%20as%20well). The idea is to use firewalld/iptables to maintain the base firewall (open/close ports, permanent allow/deny lists), and let Fail2Ban handle dynamic blocking of bad actors based on log patterns (just as LFD did). This separation follows the Unix philosophy (“do one thing well”) – some in the community prefer a dedicated tool like Fail2Ban for intrusion detection rather than relying on CSF’s all-in-one approach[\[50\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=,could%20centminmod%20switch%20to%20firewalld). The trade-off is that CSF/LFD was very tailored and turnkey, whereas setting up Fail2Ban requires configuring the appropriate “jail” rules for each service and ensuring it works with whichever firewall backend you choose. That said, fail2ban is very flexible and widely used, and it continues to be maintained.

* **UFW** (with Fail2Ban): On Ubuntu or Debian servers (where CSF was also used by some), UFW (which is essentially a command-line simplification of iptables) can replace the static firewall function. A user on the Enhance forum commented that **“UFW \+ Fail2Ban is a good combination. You can do a lot with F2B.”**[\[51\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=net) This combo on Ubuntu mimics the CSF+LFD pairing on CentOS. UFW lacks a GUI by itself but is easy to use via CLI for basic rules, and many tutorials exist for integrating it with Fail2Ban.

* **Other iptables front-ends**: Some older alternatives like **APF (Advanced Policy Firewall)** and **Shorewall** were used before CSF became dominant. Shorewall is powerful and still maintained, but it’s configured via multiple text files and might be too complex for newcomers. In a past discussion, a Centmin Mod user noted Shorewall’s manual setup was not as automation-friendly and lacked the integrated login failure daemon that CSF provides[\[52\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=,CSF%20Firewall%20has%20%3F)[\[53\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=files%20in%20a%20syntax%20that,Code). APF, on the other hand, has not seen much recent development. Given that firewalld and ufw are readily available and supported by distro vendors, they are generally preferred over resurrecting older projects.

In addition to firewall+ban solutions, **if you use a hosting control panel, check its built-in security features**. For instance, cPanel’s **cPHulk** (free with cPanel) can block brute force attacks on FTP/SSH/WHM at the application level, and DirectAdmin’s login failure daemon (BFD) provides some anti-bruteforce measures. These aren’t full replacements for CSF, but they can cover some of the ground and should be enabled if available. For spam monitoring (outgoing email spam, which CSF’s SMTP checks and the separate OSM tool handled), you may need other tools or scripts – e.g. Exim rate limiting or rspamd metrics.

**Commercial security suites** are an alternative route (not free, but worth mentioning). Imunify360 (by CloudLinux) includes a firewall (with herd immunity IP reputation blocking), intrusion detection, malware scanning (replacing CXS), etc. It integrates with cPanel, Plesk, and DirectAdmin. OpsShield cPGuard is another commercial tool in this space, and as noted, they are extending it to work without CSF[\[28\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=opsshield). **BitNinja**, **ConfigServer’s own paid products** (which unfortunately also shut down), and others offer one-stop security. However, since the question is specifically about *free* options, the focus remains on open-source solutions like firewalld/Fail2Ban.

### The Firewalld \+ “CSF-Wrapper” Idea

The user’s proposed idea is to utilize **firewalld** (with nftables support) as the backend and create a **wrapper script that mimics the csf command-line interface**. This would essentially translate familiar CSF commands/options (such as csf \-l to list rules, csf \-a IP to whitelist an IP, csf \-d IP to blacklist an IP, etc.) into the equivalent firewalld or nftables commands. The rationale is that it could provide continuity for admins used to CSF, and possibly allow existing automation (scripts that call csf) to continue working, while under the hood managing a completely different firewall system.

**How feasible is this approach?** It’s technically feasible because most of CSF’s user-facing operations have direct analogues in firewalld/iptables:

* Listing IPv4/IPv6 rules (csf \-l/-l6) could call firewall-cmd \--list-all (or iptables \-L) for the appropriate families.

* Adding an allow rule (csf \-a IP) is essentially adding an IP to an allowlist – firewalld could handle this via a rich rule or by adding to a trusted IP set. Similarly, csf \-d IP (deny) translates to adding a drop rule for that IP.

* Temporary blocks (csf \-td IP ttl) could be achieved by adding a firewalld rule with a timeout (firewalld supports timeout on rich rules) or by delegating to **fail2ban** which naturally handles temporary bans.

* Opening/closing ports (normally done by editing csf.conf and restarting CSF) could be managed by the wrapper parsing csf.conf or by providing commands analogous to firewall-cmd \--add-port=PORT/PROTOCOL.

Essentially, the wrapper would need to maintain lists similar to /etc/csf/csf.allow and csf.deny, and ensure those are applied in firewalld. It’s not a trivial script, but certainly a doable project for someone with knowledge of both CSF and firewalld. It could even reuse parts of CSF’s parsing logic (since CSF is now open source) to read the config and then apply rules via firewalld’s D-Bus or CLI interface.

However, as a long-term solution, a wrapper might be a stopgap. Now that CSF’s source is available, an alternative path is to modify **CSF itself to support nftables** (or use firewalld as a backend). The community could add an option in CSF to use nft commands instead of iptables, which would allow CSF to run on RHEL 10+ where only nftables is present. This is a non-trivial development effort but is very much on the table with the code in community hands. If that happens, it would negate the need for an external wrapper – CSF (the forked version) would directly manage nftables and continue largely as-is. On the other hand, if such development proves too difficult or slow, a wrapper that provides CSF-like commands on top of firewalld could be a quicker fix for admins who have muscle memory and scripts for CSF.

So far, we haven’t seen a publicly released CSF-to-firewalld wrapper script in discussions (most likely because everyone was waiting to see if CSF would be open-sourced or forked). But the concept has been implicitly endorsed by many in the sense that *“using firewalld+fail2ban”* is the recommended approach and the only missing piece is the user interface. The wrapper would essentially be that missing piece for CLI users.

One challenge to note: CSF had a **very extensive feature set** beyond basic port blocking – e.g. country blocking, port flood protection, SU logins tracking, UI integration with WHM/DirectAdmin, etc. Replicating *all* of that via a wrapper would be difficult. For example, CSF could block entire countries by loading IP CIDR lists – firewalld can do this with rich rules or ipsets, but the wrapper would need to handle pulling those lists (CSF used to download MaxMind databases or use pre-built country lists). Similarly, CSF’s lfd tailed various logs for specific patterns (exim bounce attacks, mod\_security hits, etc.) and triggered actions. Recreating those dozens of regex patterns in Fail2Ban might take some effort (though many default fail2ban jails exist for common services). In short, a partial wrapper that covers the basics (port opens, IP allows/denies, listing status) might be relatively straightforward, but a full fidelity CSF replacement via wrapper would effectively be re-implementing CSF’s logic in another language.

**Evaluation:** The idea of a CSF wrapper for firewalld/nftables is innovative and could serve as a bridge for those clinging to CSF workflows. It would allow use of modern firewall backends (future-proofing for RHEL 10\) while not retraining staff on new commands. Given that multiple community members have already manually begun migrating to firewalld (as noted in r/cpanel: “translate everything to firewalld”[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpanel/comments/1mdmyc8/way_to_the_web_csf_are_going_to_cease_to_exist/#:~:text=heavinglory)), a well-written wrapper could save time and reduce errors in translation. If no one from ConfigServer’s side is going to continue CSF, perhaps the community or a savvy individual will pursue this. On the other hand, since the **CSF project is now open-source**, the momentum might shift toward improving that project directly (for instance, integrating nftables support into CSF v15+). There’s already interest in continuing CSF – the creator of the configserverfirewall.org community expressed that many of us *“benefit so much but not giving back; \[now want to\] contribute and make it better”*[\[38\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=eddiecheng). If such contributions materialize, the quickest win would be adding support for new OS and firewall frameworks into CSF itself, making a wrapper unnecessary.

## Conclusion

The shutdown of ConfigServer Firewall has certainly left a gap, but the hosting community is responding with a mix of **short-term fixes and long-term plans**. In the short term, many are choosing to keep running CSF on existing servers (it’s stable and continues to do its job)[\[5\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Probably%20that%20is%20the%20reason,it%20still%20works%20very%20good)[\[54\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=As%20long%20as%20we%20have,it%20still%20works%20very%20good), while disabling its auto-updates and pointing it to safe mirrors to avoid any surprises[\[30\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=Registry%20Expiry%20Date%3A%202027)[\[31\]](https://forum.directadmin.com/threads/configserver-shutting-down-as-of-31st-of-august-2025.76678/#:~:text=which%20should%20be%20replaced%20by,com). For new deployments, especially on future OS releases, admins are evaluating native solutions: **firewalld/iptables with Fail2Ban** is emerging as the primary free alternative to replicate the functionality of CSF+LFD[\[49\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=csf%20also%20hasn%27t%20been%20%27forked%27%2C,on%20to%20csf)[\[24\]](http://forum.centos-webpanel.com/centos-webpanel-bugs/way-to-the-web-ltd-and-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently!/#:~:text=but%20with%20our%20CWP%2C%20CSF,solution%20of%20it%20as%20well). This combination can achieve most of what CSF did – albeit with a bit more manual setup – from basic firewalling to automated banning.

Meanwhile, the open-sourcing of CSF has opened the door for a community-driven continuation. We have already seen Centmin Mod effectively maintain their own CSF build[\[19\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,that%20update%20via%20CSF%20Firewall%27s), and others like the *OpenCSF* initiative may coalesce into a formal fork. If a strong community forms around the GitHub project (which now has the code for CSF 15.00 under GPLv3), we could soon have *“CSF 16”* or an **“OpenCSF”** that includes modern enhancements (like nftables support for RHEL 10, or even new features). This would allow those who love CSF’s interface and depth to keep using a familiar tool in the long run, just under new stewardship. As one Enhance forum user said, *“It’s a damn good piece of software that has served the hosting community well for many years”*[\[55\]](https://community.enhance.com/d/2982-configserver-will-shut-down-on-august-31-2025#:~:text=bluelinq) – and with the GPL release, it doesn’t have to die; it can be kept alive by the community.

**In summary**, other control panels and users are not uniformly abandoning CSF, but all are acknowledging the need for a Plan B. Some panels (DirectAdmin, CWP) are preparing to remove or replace CSF, while others (Centmin Mod, possibly user-driven forks) are doubling down on keeping it alive via mirrors or open-source forks. For a free, long-term solution that will work across RHEL 8/9/10 and beyond, leveraging the **native firewall (iptables/nftables)** – through tools like firewalld or UFW – combined with **Fail2Ban** (or equivalent log scanners) is the most practical path recommended by experts[\[48\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=,like%20login%20failure%20detection%2C%20I%27d)[\[50\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/switch-to-shorewall-or-another-more-modern-firewall-than-csf.5910/#:~:text=,could%20centminmod%20switch%20to%20firewalld). This approach is supported by distro maintainers and will continue to be updated with the OS. It does require replacing some of CSF’s convenience (you might lose the single csf command that did everything). That’s where the idea of a **CSF-style wrapper** around these native tools could provide a neat solution, allowing admins to use familiar commands while underneath, the system employs supported components like nftables. Whether via a wrapper or a true fork of CSF, the goal is the same: **maintain strong server firewall security without relying on a now-unsupported product**.

As of now (September 2025), the prudent course for sysadmins is to **audit your use of CSF** and take proactive steps: export or save your firewall rules, retrieve the CSF installer archive while it’s still available[\[56\]](https://forum.hestiacp.com/t/sadly-configserver-com-will-be-closing-down-permanently-on-31-august-2025/19834#:~:text=I%20suggest%20to%20everyone%20to,if%20you%20are%20using%20it), and explore implementing firewalld/Fail2Ban on test systems to get comfortable with them. Keep an eye on the emerging community projects (the official GitHub repo[\[35\]](https://community.centminmod.com/threads/csf-firewall-closing-down-august-31-2025-discussion-thread.28986/#:~:text=,csf.md) and any forks) for a possible **“CSF 2.0”**. If such a project gains traction, it could provide a seamless upgrade path (perhaps your existing csf.conf could be migrated to a new forked version that supports nftables). If not, transitioning to the native tools will ensure you’re ready when distributions like RHEL 10 drop iptables support entirely.

In the words of one forum user, this is *“the end of an era”*[\[57\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/cpanel/comments/1mdmyc8/way_to_the_web_csf_are_going_to_cease_to_exist/#:~:text=twhiting9275), but it’s also an opportunity to modernize our server security tooling. With either route – community-driven continuation or migrating to equivalent alternatives – it’s possible to maintain the same level of protection that CSF provided. The hosting community is showing resilience through collaboration, and we can expect robust solutions (whether a **maintained CSF fork or a combination of firewalld+Fail2Ban**) to fill the void, keeping servers secure in a post-CSF world.
